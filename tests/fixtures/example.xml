'''''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation''''' is a 1997 American [[Martial arts film|martial arts]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[John R. Leonetti]]. A sequel to the 1995 film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', based on the video game series ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' by [[Midway Games]], it stars [[Robin Shou]], [[Talisa Soto]], [[Brian Thompson]], [[Sandra Hess]], 
Lynn &quot;Red&quot; Williams, [[Irina Pantaeva]], [[Marjean Holden]], [[Musetta Vander]], and [[James Remar]]. Although the story picks up immediately when the last film ended, all the roles were recast, with the exception of Shou and Soto.

The film's storyline was largely an adaptation of the fighting game ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]''. The plot follows an alliance of heroic Kombatants who are led by [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] as they stop at nothing to save the Earthrealm by engaging in a series of fights with the villainous Kombatants of the Outworld who form an alliance of their own as well that is brought together by the evil tyrant [[Shao Kahn]].

''Annihilation'' has been near-universally panned by both fans and critics, resulting in a third film being cancelled. A [[Mortal Kombat (upcoming film)|film reboot]] is set to be released in the future.

==Plot==
The evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn opens a portal to Earthrealm and has resurrected his queen Sindel, Princess Kitana's long-deceased mother to facilitate his invasion. Earthrealm is to be absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which reigning Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang and his allies must prevent. When Kahn kills Johnny Cage during a confrontation with the thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors retreat to seek allies.

An emotionally distraught Sonya Blade enlists the help of her Special Forces partner, Jax. Together they destroy the robotic ninja Cyrax and Kitana's clone, Mileena. Kitana and Liu search for a Native American shaman named Nightwolf, who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu destroy another robotic ninja Smoke with the aid of Sub-Zero (the younger brother of the one seen in the original film), but Scorpion suddenly appears, attacks Sub-Zero, and kidnaps Kitana.

Meanwhile, Rayden meets with the Elder Gods and asks them why Kahn was allowed to break the tournament rules and force his way into Earthrealm, and how he can be stopped. The answers he receives are sparse and ambiguous; one says that reuniting Kitana with her mother, Sindel, is the key to breaking Kahn's hold on Earthrealm, but another Elder God insists that the defeat of Kahn himself is the solution. Raiden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival.

Liu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster's strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass three tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem, courage, and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of Jade, a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade's offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods' temple, where he and his friends are to meet Raiden. The third test is never revealed.

At the temple, the Earthrealm warriors reunite with Raiden and learn that he has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they infiltrate Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. Liu rescues Kitana, killing Baraka and Sheeva in the process, while the others incapacitate Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn's control and escapes during an ambush, while Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes' plans before he feeds Jade to a gargoyle for her failure. Raiden then reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother and that the former Elder God Shinnok is their father. He realizes that Shinnok is supporting Kahn. With renewed purpose, Raiden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to the final showdown with Kahn, Sindel,  and his remaining generals Motaro and Ermac. Shinnok demands that Raiden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Raiden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn.

After a hard fight, Jax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn's generals, but Liu struggles with Kahn, and his Animality barely proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal. Shinnok, who explains that these are the consequences for breaking the sacred rules, attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn's behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok's treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu finally defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm reverts to its former state and with Kahn's hold over Sindel finally broken, she reunites with Kitana. Raiden is revived by the other Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father's former position. With everything right in the universe once again, the Earthrealm warriors return home.

==Production==
''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'' is loosely based on the 1995 video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', while featuring the character roster of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''. There were also plot elements from ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', but these scenes were cut from the final theatrical version.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; While the original attracted casual moviegoers as well as gamers, ''Annihilation'' catered exclusively to the games' fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;craphound&quot;&gt;&quot;What's in this movie for MK gamers? 'There are more characters in this movie from the game than last time, and there's a lot of new ones, to coincide with the fourth game.' &quot;[http://www.craphound.com/nonfic/mkii.html Mortal Kombat II] - Cory Doctorow, ''SciFi Entertainment'', 11/97; reprinted on craphound.com&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Lawrence Kasanoff]] said he was trying to make the film &quot;even more spectacular than the first movie, which earned a healthy $73 million in the U.S. ''Annihilation'' is three times more ambitious than ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]''. Our theme for the sequel is to shoot for more—more fights, more special effects, more Outworld, more everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 1997|title=Mortal Kombat Annihilation!|url=https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_094_May_1997/page/n38|journal=GamePro|volume=94|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other filming locations included [[London]], Jordan, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=GPro103/&gt; Though ''Annihilation'' attempted to continue in the style of the first movie, the cast of returning characters from the original was almost completely overhauled; only Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and Talisa Soto (Kitana) reprised their roles, while the only other actor to return was [[Keith Cooke]] ([[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] in the first film) as [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]. Stephen Painter and [[Neill Gorton]] provided some of the props for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Dave|date=May 1998|title=Alias Gore and Pain|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_172_1998_Species_2_HQS_c2c/page/n55|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=172|pages=57–62|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French release of the movie was known as ''Mortal Kombat: Destruction Finale'' (''Final Destruction''), while the Italian release was titled ''Mortal Kombat: Distruzione Totale'' (''Total Destruction''). The film's novelization by Jerome Preisler was published through [[Tor Books]].

Thai actor and martial artist [[Tony Jaa]] was a stunt double for Robin Shou in ''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Bryan |title=Meet the Next Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/International/story?id=497530 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |work=[[ABC News]] |agency=[[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=23 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'' was released on November 21, 1997, and its opening weekend take was $16 million, enough for a number-one debut at the box office. It grossed $35 million domestically and made over $51 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot;/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Annihilation'' received a 2% approval rating out of 43 critic reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. The website's consensus states, &quot;With its shallow characters, low budget special effects, and mindless fight scenes, ''Mortal Kombat - Annihilation'' offers minimal plot development and manages to underachieve the low bar set by its predecessor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rotten&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mortal_kombat_annihilation/|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster|accessdate=March 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received an 11 out of 100 rating on [[Metacritic]] based on 12 reviews, indicating an &quot;overwhelming dislike.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/mortalkombatannihilation|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Gibner of [[Allmovie]] wrote, &quot;Whereas the first film was a guilty schlock pleasure, this sequel is an exercise in the art of genuinely beautiful trash cinema.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmovie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/mortal-kombat-annihilation-v158861/review|last=Gibner|first=Jason|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie Baumgarten of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' opined that it was &quot;nothing more than a perpetual chain of elaborately choreographed fight sequences that ... are linked together by the most flimsy and laughable of plot elements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;austin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3a140917|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|work=Austin Chronicle|date=November 28, 1997|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a &quot;D–&quot; rating, calling it &quot;abysmal&quot; and &quot;incoherent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,290585,00.html|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|last=Glieberman|first=Owen|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 5, 1997|accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; R.L Shaffer of [[IGN]] wrote in 2011: &quot;''Mortal Kombat: Annihilation'' is a bad movie. No way around it. Over the years, however, it has evolved into a cult hit of sorts, playing as an unintentional comedy – a spoof of the early video game movies and their painfully obvious cash-in mentality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/21/mortal-kombat-annihilation-blu-ray-review|title=Mortal Kombat: Annihilation Blu-ray Review|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate 2012 interviews, ''Mortal Kombat'' co-creators [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] selected ''Annihilation'' as their personal worst moments in the history of their work on the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2012/nov/07/john-tobias-if-i-could-go-back-and-redo-kabal-and-stryker-i-would-i-dont-know-if-id-design-them-differently-or-just-come-new-character/|title=John Tobias: 'If I could go back and redo Kabal and Stryker I would, I don't know if I'd design them differently or just come up with new characters'|date=2012-11-07|website=EventHubs|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancelled sequel==
Robin Shou's original ''Mortal Kombat'' contract was a three-picture deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Annihilation!|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=104 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1997|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Threshold Entertainment]]'s production on a second sequel was initially scheduled to commence shortly after the release of ''Annihilation'', but it was shelved due to ''Annihilation's'' poor reception and disappointing box-office performance. Attempts to produce a third film since then have remained stuck in [[development hell]] with numerous script rewrites and storyline, cast, and crew changes. A November 2001 poll on the official ''Mortal Kombat'' website hosted by Threshold asked fans which characters they believed would die in the third movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;mk1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mortalkombat.com|title=Mortal Kombat|publisher=[[Threshold Entertainment]]|date=November 28, 2001|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011128234706/http://mortalkombat.com/|archive-date=November 28, 2001|access-date=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005 destruction of [[New Orleans]] by [[Hurricane Katrina]] greatly affected one of the film's planned shooting locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;mink interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Clint|last= Morris |title=Director talks ''Mortal Kombat'' reboot |publisher=Moviehole.net |date=2008-02-08 |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20080208_director_talks_mortal_kombat_r.htmlOr |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120808020206/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20080208_director_talks_mortal_kombat_r.htmlOr |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, a bankruptcy court lawsuit saw Lawrence Kasanoff suing [[Midway Games]] while mentioning that a third film was in the works. [[Warner Bros.]] (which became the parent of New Line Cinema in 2008, after over a decade of both operating as separate divisions of [[Time Warner]]) ended up purchasing most of Midway's assets, including ''Mortal Kombat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=WB Picks Up Rights to Midway Video Games|publisher=Comingsoon.net|date=2009-07-06|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=56887|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parys Mountain''' ({{lang-cy|Mynydd Parys}}) is located south of the town of [[Amlwch]] in north east [[Anglesey]], Wales. It is the site of a large [[copper]] mine that was extensively exploited in the late 18th century.

== History ==

The mountain was mined for copper ore in the early [[Bronze Age]], as shown by sub-surface debris nearly 4,000 years old revealed during excavations in 2002. Since then access has been regained to the sealed underground workings of the Parys mine revealing further evidence for this ancient mining. Parys Mountain is thus one of the few sites in Britain where there is evidence for the prehistoric beginnings of the British metal mining industry.

The 18th century miners recognised that they were following in the steps of much earlier workers, an observation that was then linked to the discovery locally of copper ingots bearing [[Roman Britain|Roman]] inscriptions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1764 [[Charles Roe]] of [[Macclesfield]] was granted a 21-year lease by the Bayly family to work the mountain for copper. Rowland Pugh, a local miner, discovered the &quot;Great Lode&quot; on 2 March 1768 and was rewarded with a bottle of whisky and a rent-free house for his lifetime.

Although the ore here was of low quality, this was more than compensated for by the fact that it occurred in two large masses close to the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=D. B.|title=A History of Copper Mining in Cornwall and Devon|publisher=D. Bradford Barton Ltd|location=Truro|year=1978|edition=3rd|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially ore was worked on the surface from shallow shafts, next by open-pit mining and finally underground from adits or from shafts. The ore was broken into small lumps by hand, the best ore being shipped to [[Lancashire]] or to the [[Lower Swansea valley]] in [[South Wales]] through the port of [[Swansea]] for [[smelting]]. Copper was concentrated and extracted from the remainder using kilns and furnaces on site. It was also discovered that purer metal could be obtained efficiently, although in small amounts, by its precipitation from drainage water with scrap iron in purpose-built ponds. Associated with the mines, important chemical industries were established on the Mountain based on by-products such as [[ochre]] pigments, [[sulfur|sulphur]], [[vitriol]] and [[alum]]. The processes were described by the German writer and translator, [[Augustin Gottfried Ludwig Lentin]] (1764–1823) who visited Parys Mountain in the 1790s and published his findings in ''Briefe über die Insel Anglesea: vorzüglich über das dasige Kupfer-Bergwerk und die dazu gehörigen Schmelzwerke und Fabriken'' (Leipzig: Crusius, 1800).[[File:Parys Penny.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Parys Penny]]

Parys Mountain dominated the world's copper market during the 1780s, when the mine was the largest in Europe.&lt;ref name=largest/&gt; Its rise severely damaged the [[Mining in Cornwall|mining industry in Cornwall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; The copper from the mine was used to [[Copper sheathing|sheath]] the British Admiralty's wooden ships of war, to prevent the growth of seaweed and [[barnacle]]s and to protect the wood from attack by [[shipworm]]s. This increased the speed and manoeuvrability of the vessels, and enabled them to remain at sea for longer as there was less need to return to port for maintenance.

In response to a national shortage of small currency, the Parys Mine Company produced its own coinage between 1787 and 1793. The Parys Penny, also known as the Anglesey Penny, was used by the mine to pay workers, and also by the populace at large. It is thought that around ten million pennies and half pennies were minted.&lt;ref&gt;P22, Copper Kingdom. Published by the Amlwch Industrial Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral [[Anglesite]] with the chemical formula PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/Sub&gt; was first recognised as a mineral species by [[William Withering]] in 1783, who discovered it in the Parys copper-mine; the name  was given by [[François Sulpice Beudant|F. S. Beudant]] in 1832.

There is a [[waymarking|waymarked]] trail around the mountain, giving views of [[Amlwch Port]] to the north and the nearby Trysglwyn [[wind farm]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglesey-today.com/copper-mountain.html Anglesey Copper Mountain]&lt;/ref&gt; Those wishing to explore the historic mine levels need to contact the Parys Underground Group.

Since 1988, Anglesey Mining plc, which owns the western part of the mountain has discovered resources of 6,500,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes containing 10% combined zinc, lead, copper with some silver and gold and has permits and a plan to restart mining operations at 350,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes per year.

In the late 1990s, surveys of the mine's hydraulic systems revealed that a large reservoir held back by a dam in an underground working was in poor condition. An assessment made at the time considered that failure of the dam was likely and that catastrophic failure could inundate parts of Amlwch causing loss of life and substantial damage to property. An added complication was that the water in the underground reservoir was highly [[water pollution|polluted]] by copper and other metals and was very acidic.

In 2003 a carefully controlled drainage operation was carried out which dropped the water levels by {{convert|70|m}}, releasing the pressure on the dam and enabling its removal.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The removal of the reservoir also gave access to many more passages and to a connection to the nearby previously inaccessible Mona Mine. The entry into these sections was filmed for the TV series ''Extreme Archaeology''.&lt;ref name=ExtremeArch/&gt;

Due to the high level of soil contamination, plant life is sparse on or near the mountain, but there are a number of examples of rare plants and bacteria. The bare, heavily mined landscape give the mountain a strange appearance which has been used in the filming of science fiction films and television shows such as a scene in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]''.

Due to the high chemical content of the water, [[snottite]]s thrive in the until recently submerged passages.&lt;ref name=ExtremeArch/&gt;

==History==
[[File:John Speed Anglesey.jpg|thumb|John Speed's map of Anglesey, 1607]]
There are numerous [[megalith]]ic monuments and [[menhir]]s on Anglesey, testifying to the presence of humans in [[prehistory]]. [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]] is near one of 28 [[Dolmen|cromlechs]] that remain on uplands overlooking the sea. The [[Welsh Triads]] claim that Anglesey was once part of the mainland.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17–18}}
[[File:Plas Newydd Anglesey House NW view.jpg|thumb|right|Plas Newydd]]
Historically, Anglesey has long been associated with the [[druid]]s. The [[Roman conquest of Anglesey]] began in AD 60 when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], determined to break the power of the druids, attacked the island using his amphibious [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavian]] contingent as a surprise [[vanguard]] assault&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus Agricola 18.3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; and then destroying the shrine and the [[nemeton|nemeta]] ([[sacred grove]]s). News of [[Boudica]]'s revolt reached him just after his victory, causing him to withdraw his army before consolidating his conquest. The island was finally brought into the Roman Empire by [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the [[Roman governor]] of Britain, in AD 78. During the Roman occupation, the area was notable for the mining of [[copper]]. The foundations of [[Caer Gybi (fort)|Caer Gybi]], a fort in [[Holyhead]], are Roman, and the present road from Holyhead to [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]] was originally a [[Roman roads|Roman road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Chisholm |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog |year=1910 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediabr00chisgoog/page/n337 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was grouped by [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] with [[Geography of Ireland|Ireland]] (&quot;[[Hibernia]]&quot;) rather than with [[Great Britain|Britain]] (&quot;[[Albion]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Ptolemy]] |title=[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geog.]] |at=Bk. 2, Ch. 1 &amp; 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Iron Age]] and Roman sites have been excavated and coins and ornaments discovered, especially by the 19th-century [[antiquarian]] [[William Owen Stanley]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, ''Anglesey'', 1871, and many Celtic contributions, especially on Celtic subjects, to ''[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]] in the early 5th century, pirates from [[Ireland]] colonised Anglesey and the nearby [[Llŷn Peninsula]]. In response to this, [[Cunedda|Cunedda ap Edern]], a [[Gododdin]] warlord from [[Scotland]], came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son [[Einion Yrth ap Cunedda]] and grandson [[Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion]]; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. As an island, Anglesey was in a good defensive position, and so [[Aberffraw]] became the site of the court, or ''Llys'', of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]. Apart from a devastating [[Denmark|Danish]] raid in 853 it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the [[England|English]] navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Norwegian Empire]].

After the Irish, the island was invaded by [[Vikings]] — some of these raids were noted in famous [[saga]]s (see [[Menai Strait#History|Menai Strait History]]) — and by [[Saxons]], and [[Normans]], before falling to [[Edward I of England]] in the 13th century.

Anglesey (together with Holy Island) is one of the 13 [[historic counties of Wales]]. In medieval times, before the conquest of Wales in 1283, ''Môn'' often had periods of temporary independence, as it was frequently bequeathed to the heirs of kings as a sub-kingdom of [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. The last times this occurred were a few years after 1171, following the death of [[Owain Gwynedd]], when the island was inherited by [[Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd]], and between 1246 and c. 1255, when it was granted to [[Owain Goch]] as his share of the kingdom. After the conquest of Wales by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Anglesey was created a county under the terms of the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] of 1284. Prior to this it had been divided into the ''[[cantref]]i'' of [[Cantref Aberffraw|Aberffraw]], [[Rhosyr (cantref)|Rhosyr]] and [[Cemais (Anglesey cantref)|Cemaes]].

===20th century===
During the [[First World War]], the Presbyterian minister and celebrity preacher John Williams toured the island as part of an effort to recruit young men to volunteer for a just war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/anglesey-during-first-world-war-2036022 |title=Anglesey during the First World War and Second World War |last=Devine |first=Darren |date=2012-02-15 |work=walesonline |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] were kept on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

By the end of the war, some 1,000 of the island's men had died while on active service.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

In 1936 the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] opened its first branch on Anglesey.&lt;ref&gt;''A Years' Work of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Annual Report for 1936-1937, adopted by the Council and Corporation, May 28, 1937'', London, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]], Anglesey received Italian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The island was designated a reception zone, and was home to evacuee children from Liverpool and Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The island's location made it an ideal place to monitor [[U-boat|German U-Boats]] operating in the [[Irish Sea]]. Around half a dozen airships operated out of [[RAF Mona|Mona]] airfield to monitor submarine activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In 1974, Anglesey became a district of the new large [[Administrative divisions of Wales#Counties|county]] of [[Gwynedd]]. The [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]] abolished the 1974 county and the five districts on 1 April 1996. Anglesey became a separate [[unitary authority]]. In 2011, the [[Welsh Government]] appointed a panel of commissioners to administer the council, thus the elected members were not in control. The commissioners remained in control until an [[Isle of Anglesey County Council election, 2013|election]] was held in May 2013, restoring an elected Council. Before the period of direct administration, there had been a majority of independent councillors. Though members did not generally divide along party lines, these were organised into five non-partisan groups on the council, containing a mix of party and independent candidates. The position remains substantially unchanged since the election, although the Labour Party has formed a governing coalition with the independents.

The principal offices of the [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]] are in [[Llangefni]], the [[county town]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |author1-link=John Davies (historian) |last2=Jenkins |first2=Nigel |author2-link=Nigel Jenkins |last3=Baines |first3=Menna |last4=Llynch |first4=Peredur |year=2008 |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |location=Cardiff |publisher=University of Wales Press |isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 |page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Britannia Bridge Train crossing 3.jpg|left|thumb|[[Britannia Bridge]] from the east along the [[Menai Strait]]]]
Anglesey is a relatively low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over the north of the island. The highest six are [[Holyhead Mountain]], {{convert|220|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd Bodafon]], {{convert|178|m|ft}}; [[Llaneilian|Mynydd Llaneilian]], {{convert|177|m|ft}}; [[Mynydd y Garn]], {{convert|170|m|ft}}; [[Bwrdd Arthur]], {{convert|164|m|ft}}; and Mynydd Llwydiarth, {{convert|158|m|ft}}. To the south and south-east, the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the [[Menai Strait]], which at its narrowest point is about {{convert|250|m|yd}} wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the [[Irish Sea]]. At 714&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it is the [[List of European islands by area|51st largest island]] in Europe, (although technically [[Madeira]] is part of Africa), and just five square kilometres smaller than [[Singapore]].

There are several small towns scattered around the island, making it quite evenly populated. The largest are [[Holyhead]], [[Llangefni]], [[Benllech]], [[Menai Bridge]], and [[Amlwch]]. [[Beaumaris]] (Welsh: ''Biwmares''), in the east of the island, features [[Beaumaris Castle]], built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] as part of his [[Bastide|Bastide Town]] campaign in [[North Wales]]. Beaumaris is a [[yachting]] centre, with many boats moored in the bay or off Gallows Point. The village of [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] (Welsh: ''Niwbwrch''), in the south, created when the townsfolk of Llanfaes were relocated to make way for the building of Beaumaris Castle, includes the site of [[Llys Rhosyr]], another of the courts of the medieval Welsh princes, which features one of the oldest courtrooms in the United Kingdom. [[Llangefni]] is located in the centre and is the island's administrative centre. The town of [[Menai Bridge]] (Welsh: ''Porthaethwy'', in the south-east) expanded when the first bridge to the mainland was being built, to accommodate workers and construction. Until then, Porthaethwy had been one of the principal ferry crossing points from the mainland. A short distance from this town lies [[Bryn Celli Ddu]], a [[Stone Age]] burial mound.

Nearby is the village with the longest name in Europe, [[Llanfairpwllgwyngyll]]gogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, and [[Plas Newydd (Anglesey)|Plas Newydd]], ancestral home of the [[Marquess of Anglesey|Marquesses of Anglesey]]. The town of [[Amlwch]] is situated in the northeast of the island and was once largely industrialised, having grown during the 18th century by supporting an important [[copper]]-mining industry at [[Parys Mountain]].

[[File:Menai Bridge - Anglesey August 2009 (3834581170).jpg|thumb|right|Menai Bridge]]
Other villages and settlements include [[Cemaes]], [[Pentraeth]], [[Gaerwen]], [[Dwyran]], [[Bodedern]], [[Malltraeth]] and [[Rhosneigr]]. The [[Anglesey Sea Zoo]] is a local tourist attraction, providing a descriptive look{{clarify|date=January 2019}} at local marine [[wildlife]] from [[Homarus gammarus|common lobsters]] to [[conger]]s. All the fish and [[crustacean]]s on display are caught around the island and placed in reconstructions of their natural [[habitat]]. The zoo also breeds lobsters commercially for food, and [[oyster]]s, for pearls, both from local stocks. Sea salt (''Halen Môn'', evaporated from the local sea water), now produced in a modern facility nearby, was formerly produced at the Sea Zoo site.

There are a few natural lakes, mostly in the west, such as [[Llyn Llywenan]], the largest on the island, Llyn Coron, and Cors Cerrig y Daran, but rivers are few and small. There are two large water supply reservoirs operated by [[Welsh Water]]. These are [[Llyn Alaw]] to the north of the island and [[Llyn Cefni]] in the centre of the island, which is fed by the headwaters of the [[Afon Cefni]].

The climate is humid (though much less so than neighbouring mountainous [[Gwynedd]]) and generally equable, being influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The land is of variable quality and it was probably much more fertile in the past. Anglesey is the home of the northernmost [[olive]] grove in Europe and presumably in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=First Welsh olive grove planted on Anglesey |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-welsh-olive-grove-planted-2262852 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |date=30 April 2007 |work=WalesOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coastal path==
The rural coastline has been designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. It has many sandy beaches, notably along its east coast between the towns of Beaumaris and Amlwch and the west coast from [[Ynys Llanddwyn]] through [[Rhosneigr]] to the bays around Carmel Head. The north coast has dramatic cliffs with small bays&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/news/topic/environment/2007/1858357/;jsessionid=468hLTYBX3BDy171zhMFJpzMYbD5Z3XtJfgl2LbyLvgz3RPG8vmy!686978193?lang=en |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060924153111/new.wales.gov.uk/location/north_west_wales/anob/?lang=en |date=13 December 2007 |archivedate=24 September 2006 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |title=40 years of outstanding natural beauty |publisher=[[Welsh Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglesey Coastal Path]] circumscribes the island. It is {{convert|124|mi}} long and passes by/through 20 towns/villages. The official starting point is [[St Cybi's Church, Holyhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitanglesey.co.uk/about-anglesey/isle-of-anglesey-coastal-path/ |title=Visit Anglesey – Home |author= |date= |website=Visit Anglesey |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Tourism is now the major economic activity on the island. Agriculture provides the secondary source of income for the economy, with local dairies being some of the most productive in the region.

Major industry is restricted to Holyhead (Caergybi), which until 30 September 2009 supported an [[aluminium smelting|aluminium smelter]], and the [[Amlwch]] area, once a copper mining town. Nearby is the site of the former [[Wylfa Nuclear Power Station]] and a former [[bromine]] extraction plant. With construction starting in 1963, the two Wylfa reactors began producing electricity in 1971. One reactor was decommissioned in 2012 and the other in 2015. Plans were developed for a replacement reactor, planned by [[Horizon Nuclear Power|Horizon]], a subsidiary of [[Hitachi]], to start production in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/reduced-subsidies-onshore-windfarms-good-news |title=Renewables industry welcomes reduced subsidies for onshore windfarms |author=Damian Carrington |work=the Guardian |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement has been enthusiastically endorsed by Anglesey Council and Welsh Assembly members, but protesters have raised doubts about the economic and safety claims made for the plant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/8596392.stm Anglesey protest over plans for new nuclear power plant] BBC News, 30 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2019 Hitachi announced it was putting development work on hold, which meant the plant's future was put in serious doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hitachi's Wylfa nuclear project pause 'tremendous blow' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46902723 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglesey has three wind farms on land.&lt;ref name=energy&gt;[http://www.anglesey-today.com/energy.html Anglesey Today: Energy] accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans for the installation of tidal flow turbines, near [[The Skerries, Isle of Anglesey|The Skerries]], off the north coast,&lt;ref&gt;[http://seagenwales.co.uk/ SeaGen Wales] accessed 15 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and for a major [[biomass]] plant on [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]] (Ynys Gybi). Developing such low-carbon energy assets to their full potential forms part of the Anglesey Energy Island project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.anglesey.gov.uk/business/energy-island/ Energy Island Programme] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222044229/https://www.anglesey.gov.uk/business/energy-island/ |date=2014-02-22}}, accessed 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{needs update|date=October 2020}}

When the aluminium smelter closed in September 2009, it reduced its workforce from 450 to 80; this has been a major blow to the island's economy, especially to Holyhead. The Royal Air Force station [[RAF Valley]] (Y Fali) is home to the RAF Fast Jet Training School and 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment to about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the 22 Sqn Search and Rescue headquarters.

There is a wide range of smaller industries, mostly in industrial and business parks, especially at [[Llangefni]] and [[Gaerwen]]. These include an [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]], [[fine chemical]] manufacturing, and factories for timber production, aluminium smelting, fish farming and food processing.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The island is on one of the main road routes from Britain to [[Ireland]], via [[ferry|ferries]] from [[Holyhead]], off the west of Anglesey on Holy Island, serving [[Dún Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin]] Port.

==Ecology and conservation==
Much of Anglesey is used for relatively intensive cattle and sheep farming. However, there are several important [[wetland]] sites that have protected status. In addition, the several lakes all have significant ecological interest, including their support for a wide range of aquatic and semi-aquatic bird species. In the west, the [[Malltraeth Marsh]]es are believed to support an occasional visiting [[bittern]], and the nearby estuary of the [[River Cefni|Afon Cefni]] supports a bird population made internationally famous by the paintings of [[Charles Tunnicliffe]], who lived for many years and died at [[Malltraeth]] on the Cefni estuary. The [[RAF]] airstrip at Mona is a nesting site for [[skylark]]s. The sheer cliff faces at [[South Stack]] near [[Holyhead]] provide nesting sites for huge numbers of [[auk]]s, including [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[common guillemot|guillemot]]s, together with [[chough]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s. Anglesey is home to several species of tern, including the [[roseate tern]]. Three sites on Anglesey are important for breeding terns – see [[Anglesey tern colonies]].

There are marked occurrences of the [[Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre fen-meadow|''Juncus subnodulosus''–''Cirsium palustre'' fen-meadow]] [[plant association]], a [[habitat]] marked by certain hydrophilic grasses, sedges and forbs.&lt;ref&gt;*C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=48639 ''Marsh Thistle: Cirsium palustre'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

Anglesey supports two of the UK's few remaining colonies of [[red squirrel]]s, at [[Pentraeth]] and [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.redsquirrels.info |title=Home – Squirrels Map |work=Squirrels Map |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost the entire coastline of Anglesey is designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) to protect the aesthetic appeal and variety of the island's coastal landscape and habitats from inappropriate development. The coastal zone of Anglesey was designated as an AONB in 1966 and confirmed as such in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The AONB is predominantly a coastal designation, covering most of Anglesey's {{convert|125|mi|km|0}} coastline but also encompasses Holyhead Mountain and Mynydd Bodafon. Substantial areas of other land protected by the AONB form the backdrop to the coast. The AONB is about 221&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (85 sq mi) and it is the largest AONB in Wales, covering one third of the island.

A number of the habitats in Anglesey gain still greater protection through both UK and European designations of their nature conservation value. These include:
*6 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs)
*4 Special Protection Areas (SPAs)
*1 National Nature Reserve
*26 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
*52 Scheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs)
These habitats support a variety of wildlife, such as [[harbour porpoise]]s and [[marsh fritillary]].

The AONB also takes in three sections of open, undeveloped coastline designated as Heritage Coast. These non-statutory designations complement the AONB and cover about {{convert|31|mi|km|0}} of the coastline. The sections of Heritage Coast are:
#North Anglesey {{convert|28.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}
#Holyhead Mountain {{convert|12.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}
#Aberffraw Bay {{convert|7.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}

Popular recreations include sailing, angling, cycling, walking, wind surfing and jet skiing. They place pressures and demands on the AONB, while contributing to the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/index.htm |title=Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty |publisher=Pixaerial: North Wales from the Air |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218223715/http://www.sos.bangor.ac.uk/aerial/gallery.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2007 |language=English |access-date=February 21, 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abandoned nuclear plan==
On 17 January 2019, Hitachi-Horizon Nuclear Power announced it was abandoning plans to build a nuclear plant on the Wylfa Newydd site in Anglesey. There had been concern that the start of the project might involve too much public expenditure, but Hitachi-Horizon say the decision to scrap has cost the company over £2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/17/hitachi-set-to-scrap-16bn-nuclear-project-anglesey-wales |title=Hitachi scraps £16bn nuclear power station in Wales |first=Adam |last=Vaughan |date=17 January 2019 |publisher= |via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.horizonnuclearpower.com/our-sites/wylfa-newydd Hitachi-Horizon Nuclear Power Retrieved 3 May 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/09/plans-for-welsh-nuclear-power-plant-delayed-concerns-seabirds-anglesey-tern-colonies-wylfa |title=Plans for Welsh nuclear power plant delayed by concerns over seabirds |first=Adam |last=Vaughan |date=9 April 2018 |publisher= |via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/dd916c18-facd-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167 |title=UK and Japan look at public finance for Wylfa nuclear plant |author= |date= |website=Financial Times |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Anglesey hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1957, 1983, 1999, and 2017.

It is also a member of the [[International Island Games Association]]. Anglesey's biggest successes were at the [[1997 Island Games]] held in [[Jersey]], (11th in the medals table, with two gold, three silver and nine bronze medals) and the [[2005 Island Games]] in the [[Shetland Islands]], (again 11th, with 4 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze).

The annual Anglesey Show is held on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of August. Farmers from around the country compete in livestock rearing contests, including sheep and cattle.

Anglesey has featured in the [[Channel 4]] archaeological television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' (series 14). The episode was transmitted on 4 February 2007.

The island hosts Gottwood, an electronic music and arts festival held each summer at the Carreglwyd estate. The Druidic college at Anglesey is referred to in the metal band [[Eluveitie]]'s song &quot;Inis Mona&quot;, an incorrect spelling of Ynys Môn.

[[Capital Cymru]], a commercial [[contemporary hit radio]] station, also covers [[Gwynedd]]. [[Môn FM]], a volunteer community radio station, broadcasts from the county town, Llangefni.

In 2018, the [[BBC]] began a three-part series entitled ''Anglesey: Island Lives'', detailing the lives of several residents of the island. In the first episode, Kris Hughes, a noted companion of the Druid community and the [[The Druid Order|Anglesey Druid Order]], was followed as the order marked the Summer Solstice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b099w9ys/episodes/guide BBC One site. Retrieved 19 July 2020.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welsh language==
Anglesey is a stronghold of the [[Welsh language]] and according to the 2011 census it was the local authority with the second highest proportion of Welsh speakers. The earlier percentages of Welsh speakers are these:
*1901: 91%&lt;ref name=&quot;Census-Report&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser2?ResourceType=Census&amp;ResourceType=Legislation&amp;SearchTerms=welsh+speakers+1911&amp;simple=yes&amp;path=Results/Census/1911&amp;active=yes&amp;treestate=expandnew&amp;titlepos=0&amp;mno=156&amp;tocstate=expandnew&amp;tocseq=300&amp;display=sections&amp;display=tables&amp;display=pagetitles&amp;pageseq=first-nonblank |title=Language spoken in Wales, 1911|page=iv |first= |last= |date= |website=www.histpop.org |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Welsh is less widely used on the island, but remains the dominant language in certain areas, particularly in the centre, including the town of [[Llangefni]], and some areas of the south coast. The island's five secondary schools vary widely in the percentage of their pupils who come from predominantly Welsh-speaking homes, as do the percentages who can speak Welsh:
*[[Ysgol David Hughes]] (in [[Menai Bridge]]): 33% come from Welsh-speaking homes; 90% &quot;can speak Welsh.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Estyn Report,2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.estyn.gov.wales/thematic-reports/linguistic-progression-and-standards-welsh-ten-bilingual-schools-november-2014 |title=Linguistic progression and standards of Welsh in ten bilingual schools - November 2014 - Estyn |author= |date= |website=www.estyn.gov.wales |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni]] (in [[Llangefni]]): 68% of pupils speak Welsh as their [[first language]]; 87% of pupils take their exams through the medium of Welsh.
*[[Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones]] (in [[Amlwch]]): 34% of pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes; 82% sit the Welsh First Language [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE).
*[[Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern]] (in [[Bodedern]]): 67% of pupils come from Welsh-speaking homes; &quot;a majority&quot; speak Welsh fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.estyn.gov.wales/sites/default/files/documents/Inspection%20report%20Ysgol%20Uwchradd%20Bodedern%202014.pdf|title=Ysgol Uwchradd Bodedern Estyn Report 2014 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Estyn |access-date=28 October 2016}}{{Dead link |date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The geology of Anglesey is notably complex and frequently targeted for geology [[field trip]]s by schools and colleges. Younger strata in Anglesey rest upon a foundation of very old [[Precambrian]] rocks that appear at the surface in four areas:
#a western region including Holyhead and [[Llanfaethlu]]{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17–18}}

These Precambrian rocks are [[schist]]s and [[phyllite]]s, often contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the formations in the island is from north-east to south-west.{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17–18}}} A belt of [[granitic|granitic rocks]] lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from [[Llanfaelog]] near the coast to the vicinity of [[Llanerchymedd]]. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of [[Ordovician]] slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out in the north of the island between [[Dulas Bay]] and Carmel Point.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} A small patch of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses [[Carboniferous]] rocks are found. The [[Carboniferous Limestone]] occupies a broad area south of [[Lligwy Bay]] and [[Pentraeth]], and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by [[Llangefni]] to [[Malltraeth|Malltraeth Sands]]. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow [[sandstone]] (sometimes considered to be of [[Old Red Sandstone]] age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around [[Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd|Llanfihangel]] and [[Llangoed]]; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the [[Menai Strait]]. [[Puffin Island, Anglesey|Puffin Island]] is made of carboniferous limestone. [[Malltraeth#Malltraeth Marsh|Malltraeth Marsh]] is occupied by Coal Measures, and a small patch of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the [[Menai Strait]]. A patch of rhyolitic/[[felsite|felsitic]] rocks form [[Parys Mountain]], where copper and iron ochre have been worked. [[serpentine group|Serpentine]] (Mona Marble) is found near [[Llanfair-yn-Neubwll]] and upon the opposite shore in [[Holyhead]].{{sfn |Chisholm |1911 |pp=17–18}}

Under the name ''[[GeoMôn]]'', in recognition of its extraordinary geological heritage, the island gained membership of the [[European Geoparks Network]] in spring 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geomon.co.uk/#/about/4533286655 |title=GeoMôn – Anglesey Geopark |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Global Network of National Geoparks|Global Geoparks Network]] in September 2010.

There are 50 primary schools in Anglesey, all co-educational day schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglesey.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=2601 Isle of Anglesey County Council, Serving Anglesey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524092417/http://www.anglesey.gov.uk/doc.asp?cat=2601 |date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Anglesey is linked to the mainland by the [[Britannia Bridge]], which carries the [[A55 road|A55]] from [[Holyhead]], and the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]], which carries the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. The [[A5025 road|A5025]] round the northern edge of Anglesey and the [[A4080 road|A4080]] round the southern edge form a ring.

Anglesey's six railway stations are [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]], [[Valley railway station|Valley]], [[Rhosneigr railway station|Rhosneigr]], [[Ty Croes railway station|Ty Croes]], [[Bodorgan railway station|Bodorgan]] and [[Llanfairpwll railway station|Llanfairpwll]]. All are on the [[North Wales Coast Line]], with services operated by [[Avanti West Coast]] to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], and by [[Transport for Wales Rail]] to [[Chester railway station|Chester]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]]. Historically the island was also served by the [[Anglesey Central Railway]] which ran from [[Gaerwen]] to [[Amlwch]], and the [[Red Wharf Bay branch line]] between the [[Holland Arms railway station]] and [[Red Wharf Bay]].

By air, [[Anglesey Airport]] has a twice-daily scheduled service to [[Cardiff Airport]], where connections worldwide can be made.

The [[ferry]] [[port of Holyhead]] handles more than 2 million passengers each year. [[Stena Line]] and [[Irish Ferries]] sail to [[Dublin]] and previously to [[Dún Laoghaire]] in [[Ireland]], forming the principal link for surface [[transport]] from central and northern [[England]] and [[Wales]] to [[Ireland]].

==Sport and leisure==
Anglesey is independently represented in the [[Island Games]] (under its Welsh name ''Ynys Môn''). The team finished joint 17th in the [[2009 Island Games|2009 Games]] hosted by [[Åland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NatWest Island Games XIII – Medal Table |url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning medals in [[gymnastics]], [[sailing (sport)|sailing]] and [[shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NatWest Island Games XIII – Ynys Môn Medal Winners |url=http://www.alandresults2009.com/medal.aspx?IslandID=22 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglesey made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2009 games, led by Ynys Môn MP [[Albert Owen]]. The island expected to benefit from more than £3m of spending if it had hosted the event. However, Anglesey currently lacks two facilities necessary for a successful bid: a six-lane competition swimming pool and an athletics track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clark |first=Rhodri |title=Out of the running for island 'Olympics' |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/08/02/out-of-the-running-for-island-olympics-91466-21452392/ |accessdate=30 August 2010 |newspaper=Western Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several precursors to the modern football codes were highly popular in Anglesey. They had few rules, and were quite violent. Rhys Cox, at the turn of the 18th century, described a game in [[Llandrygan]] as ending with &quot;numbers of players...  left here and there on the road, some having limbs broken in the struggle, others severely injured, and some carried on biers to be buried in the churchyard nearest to where they had been mortally injured.&quot; William Bulkeley, in his April 1734 diary, records that the violence of such games left no hard feelings, with both sides parting &quot;as good friends as they came, after they had spent half an hour together cherishing their spirits with a cup of ale... having finished Easter Holydays innocently and merrily.&quot;{{sfnp |ETBRS |2005b}}

===Association football===
Football arrived on the island in the 1870s. It was initially met with resistance, given its locally perceived associations with drunkenness and rowdiness, and the lower classes. One critic dismissed it as &quot;un-Christian practice&quot;. The Anglesey League, comprising teams from [[Amlwch]], [[Beaumaris]], [[Holyhead]], [[Menai Bridge]], [[Llandegfan]], and [[Llangefni]], was, however, formed in the 1895–1896 football season.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}

The [[Anglesey football team|Ynys Môn]] football team represent the island of Anglesey at the biannual [[Island Games]], winning gold in 1999. In 2018, the island was chosen to host the [[2019 Inter Games Football Tournament]], where the men's team won gold and the women's team won silver.

For the 2019–2020 season, [[Llangefni Town F.C.|Llangefni Town]] is playing in the [[Cymru North]] league – in the second tier of the [[Welsh football league system]], after winning the [[Welsh Alliance League]] title the previous season.

There are seven Anglesey clubs playing in the Welsh Alliance, including [[Bodedern Athletic F.C.|Bodedern Athletic]] and [[Holyhead Hotspur F.C.|Holyhead Hotspur]] in Division One. Local clubs also participate in the [[Gwynedd League]] and the [[Anglesey League]].

===Rugby Union===
[[Llangefni RFC]] is the island's highest competing team in the [[WRU Division One North]].

[[Llangoed]] hosts an annual [[rugby sevens]] contest. Touring sides have included Manhattan RFC.

===Anglesey Hunt===
The Anglesey Hunt, formed in 1757, was the second oldest [[fox hunting]] association in Wales (the oldest being the Tivyside Hunt in Cardiganshire).{{sfnp|ETBRS|2005a}}

===Athletics===
Every September the Anglesey Festival of Running takes place. It includes a marathon, a half-marathon, 10-km and 5–km races, and children's contests. Its slogan is ''Run the Island''.

===Motorsport===
The [[Anglesey Circuit]] (Welsh: Trac Môn) is a fully licensed MSA and ACU championship racing circuit that opened in 1997.

===Cricket===
The Beaumaris Cricket Club was formed in 1858. Clubs at [[Holyhead]], [[Amlwch]] and [[Llangefni]] were formed within the following decade, but it was not until the 1880s that the sport became popular outside the upper classes. [[Bodedern]] Cricket Club was formed in 1947.{{sfnp |Pretty |2005}}

===Sailing===
The Royal Anglesey Yacht Club hosts the Menai Strait Regatta yearly.

===Swimming===
The Menai Strait hosts two annual open-water swimming contests: the Menai Strait Swim from Foel to Caernarfon (1 mile), and the Pier to Pier Open Water Swim, between [[Beaumaris Pier|Beaumaris]] and [[Garth Pier]], Bangor.
